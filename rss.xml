This is the first version of TWBlue that we are releasing during 2024. The beginning of this year marks some important milestones, such as the project's domain change, which will transition from twblue.es to using the domain &lt;a href="https://twblue.mcvsoftware.com"&gt;twblue.mcvsoftware.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the initial release of TWBlue exclusively for 64-bit, as we have encountered growing issues in generating the distributable version of TWBlue on 32-bit architectures due to certain libraries used in the process no longer supporting this architecture. Finally, the generated versions of TWBlue will be published on &lt;a href="https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/releases"&gt;GitHub Releases,&lt;/a&gt; making it easier to locate additional versions and find previous software releases. All these changes have been implemented with the aim of making the project easier to maintain, more intuitive for users, and ultimately shortening the development cycle between each release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twblue.mcvsoftware.com/posts/2024.1.5/"&gt;Read moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://twblue.mcvsoftware.com/posts/2024.1.5/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 14:20:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
